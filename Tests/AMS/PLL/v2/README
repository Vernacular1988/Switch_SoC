These are attempts to use the PLL block in the TUV_AMS_Library BB

V0 just called the PLL and got the error 
Error: SystemC-AMS: Method set_delay of port: pll1.vco_sub.sca_tdf_out_0 
can only be called in the context of set_attributes of the parent module 
(see LRM clause 4.1.1.4.5, 4.1.1.5.5)

V1 took a copy of the PLL code and attempted to hack the set_delay problem
unsucessfully.

V2 added an explicit delay element into the PLL in a flat version of everything
this worked after fixing the code to insert the initial value to the output (which is needed since there is a delay) one must use out.initialize(value) vs out.write(value) to set the value on port "out". 

V3 is to package that back up
