These are attempts to use the PLL block in the TUV_AMS_Library BB

V0 just called the PLL and got the error 
Error: SystemC-AMS: Method set_delay of port: pll1.vco_sub.sca_tdf_out_0 
can only be called in the context of set_attributes of the parent module 
(see LRM clause 4.1.1.4.5, 4.1.1.5.5)

V1 took a copy of the PLL code and attempted to hack the set_delay problem
unsucessfully.

V2 added an explicit delay element into the PLL in a flat version of
everything this worked after fixing the code to insert the initial
value to the output (which is needed since there is a delay) one must
use out.initialize(value) vs out.write(value) to set the value on port
"out".

V3 is to package that back up, which is not easy - so the delay and
sink are clearly done, but the pll is still a problem. basically
hierarhcy for analog blocks are not supported. So the Pll needs to be
in a digital block (or in an analog block in a digital block) and then
the rest need to be in another block and then connected with digital
signals. (for V4..)

V4 does build hierarchy but not with sc_signals. It has one interconnect between a top module and a drain. in the top modudule is the sin source and the pll
the pll is a sc_module (not sca_) and therefor it can have hierarchy too.
(which is the way it is in the original librarary - but i missed that) So the pll (my_pll) has the four component (it has the delay element)

V5 has 3 plls (it did have two) each sending its output to the next (1->2) in round robin. This does not converge, they just chase each other around in phase/freqency space.
