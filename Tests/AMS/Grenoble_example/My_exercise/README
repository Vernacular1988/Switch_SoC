// this directory has my best guess of what the 
// Fraunhofer Institut Integrierte Schaltungen - EAS Dresden 
// wanted people to do for their tutorial from the Grenoble workshop
// there was not much hints on the slides that went with the example
// but this "works"
// Note that gtkwave does display the analog wavfoms as waves, 
// but that it scales all the waves to use the space (even if you add analog
// spacers) so you do not see the amplititude of the output of 
// the filter chanve much. You have to look at the values themselves.
