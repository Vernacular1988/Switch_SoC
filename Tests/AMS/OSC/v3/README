// oscilator model tests based on inverter macro model
// inverter is modeled as a transfer function of the form erfc (int of gauss)
// need to add a delay to this transfer in order to allow system-c ams 
// simulation using TDF model of compuation.
// Using TDF vs trying to use ELN (conservative electrical) since the solver
// for ELN is only good for linear circuts. We can add eln components as a
// linear network in the feedback of the inverter to make an oscilator
// therefore the two models (TDF inverter+delay and ELN feedback) give a
// non-linear oscilator. 
//
// for new system-c/ams users, it is important to note the different types
// of models used in the different files and the different types of signals
// (ports) between them. 
//
// we also look at coupling oscilators 
//
// v1 - all the pieces 
// v2 - cleaner version of oscilator hierarchy with coupling resistors 
// v3 - more cleaup (remove explicit delay)
